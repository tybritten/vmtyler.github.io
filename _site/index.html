	  				<p>A number of different posts and podcasts have been floating around on the topic of email management recently and I thought it would be a good time to explain how I handle it.</p>
<h5>Inbox: Meh - A Philosophy</h5>
<p>The first main premise of my system is to treat your email with the distain it deserves; most of what clutters your inbox is useless. Similar to your actual postal mail, there are bits and pieces that show up that are important, but most of it is junk. The biggest difference that makes email so much worse is that it takes almost no effort to send email, and you can send it to tens of thousands of people with one click.</p>
<p>The second main premise is for 99.999% of the population email management isn't your actual job; your company is generally paying you for something much more useful/valuable. So please put away your mailbox OCD, stop caring how many messages are in your inbox, and get rid of most of your folder management schemes. If you like sorting mail so much, I'm sure the mailroom or post office has openings.</p>

	  				<p>I've been talking to customers about tech for a number of years and many bring up the term "lock-in." They ask "will this product lock us in?" or "We're choosing to go with solution X because we're not locked in." I've had a few thoughts on this issue that I've shared with customers, but I was spurred into putting this post together by a discussion around <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nigelpoulton">@nigelpoulton's</a> post comparing <a href="http://blog.nigelpoulton.com/vsan-is-no-better-than-a-hw-array/">VSAN and HW arrays</a> where he mentions lock-in.</p>
<p>I posited that this long-feared gremlin of IT <em>doesn't exist, and may never have.</em></p>
<h3>What Really is Lock-in?</h3>
<p>When I ask customers that are concerned about lock-in to explain what they mean, they always respond with something along the lines of "I don't want to be stuck with this later."<br />
Ok, now we're getting somewhere. Usually I can get them to boil it down to a situation where changing isn't feasible due to high cost- either time or money.<br />
That's pretty reasonable, but here are the main problems with how IT people generally think about lock-in:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's expressed as a binary state; you're either locked-in or you're not</li>
<li>The actual costs of being locked-in are never adequately quantified</li>
<li>There's plenty of time and money spent avoiding lock-in but it's generally not quantified</li>
</ul>

	  				<p>In my lab I’ve been using the Mirantis OpenStack distribution (most recently 5.0.1) since it has a deployment tool called Fuel which makes it really easy to deploy and configure. There’s even a virtualbox script to setup an entire environment on your laptop- <a title="" href="http://samuraiincloud.com/2014/08/13/building-openstack-icehouse-in-virtualbox-in-60-minutes-using-mirantis-fuel-2/" target="_blank">Check out Masa’s post on it here</a>.</p>
<p>Mirantis OpenStack 5.1 was released yesterday with some cool new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Fuel Master Node can be upgraded from 5.0.x</li>
<li>Fuel 5.1 can update existing 5.0.x Mirantis OpenStack environments to 5.0.2 (Experimental)</li>
<li>Fuel is now protected by access control</li>
<li>Mirantis OpenStack now deploys the ML2 Open vSwitch plug-in for Neutron</li>
<li>Experimental features must be explicitly enabled for Mirantis OpenStack</li>
<li>The Fuel Master Node can now be backed up and restored</li>
<li>VMware NSX is now supported as a network option</li>
</ul>
<p class="">You’ll see on the list one new experimental feature. That features is to use Fuel to update your OpenStack environment (in this case 5.0.1 to 5.0.2). That’s pretty cool. Let’s give it a try.</p>

	  				<p>Not sure if your company is using social media appropriately? Here are some quick signs that they are a social media disaster:</p>
<p id="NteyZnH"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-501 size-full" src="/images/2014/09/img_541c70afa2020-full.png" alt="" width="490" height="390" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Sending internal emails to distribution lists with a list of suggested tweets/posts to cut and paste.</li>
<li>Sending internal emails to distribution lists with a link to a post/tweet with instructions that everyone should like/retweet it.</li>
<li>Measuring social media success solely by metrics like impressions, retweets, likes.</li>
<li>Encourage people to sign up for social media..just to follow/friend corporate accounts and like/retweet everything</li>
</ul>
<p>If you work for a tech company that’s existed for more than 5 years, they probably do all four of the above.</p>
