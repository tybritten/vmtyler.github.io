If you've been in IT any length of time you've heard people be called these things, called people these things, or been called these things. Why do we do that? What's the impact?

### The Myth of the Lone Genius
This is something that's mainly an American cultural thing. The idea that  the world is massively changed by some single person working by themselves in their garage or basement, toiling away at some amazing idea: the Lone Genius.

_Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Steve Jobs, Henry Ford.._

Walter Issacson [wrote a great book last year called the _Innovators_](http://smile.amazon.com/Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Created-Revolution-ebook/dp/B00JGAS65Q/)- a study in the people who built computers and the internet. What's fascinating is the takeaway [as highlighted by this essay](https://medium.com/the-aspen-journal-of-ideas/the-myth-of-the-lone-genius-6a5146c7da10) based on the book: That it wasn't individual lone geniuses, but a community either working directly together or building on previous advancements.

By continuing to promulgate this myth, we're telling people the way to be successful is to eschew teams and communities and to work alone. This hurts innovation, not helps it.

### What is the Connection?
Whether consciously or subconsciously, we re-enforce this myth on an ongoing basis by overly separating and elevating people for a multitude of reasons:

* Trying to complement the person's skills
* Trying to impress a potential client or audience
* Trying to use that person as an inspiration to others

### So What?
The effect is often the opposite of what is intended. Instead of elevating that person and that person bringing the group up too, it can cause others to disengage. They don't feel "worthy" and that they could "never be as good at that person." It can even lead to cases of [imposter syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) within groups of colleagues. 

I hear this very often in the tech community, both inside and outside of my current company. They don't see a fellow engineer that has put in hard work, increased their skills, and excelled. They see some mythical uber-techie that is so much smarter than them, so why should they even try?

### Let's Fix This.
It's ok to complement and single out a person for their abilities and achievements; it's encouraged. What we need to do is stop using these over-the-top terms to do it.
 
We need to encourage and inspire others to great things. This is the real path to innovation and success.
