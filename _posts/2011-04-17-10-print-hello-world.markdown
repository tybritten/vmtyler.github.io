<p>Isn’t that the quintessential title of the first post on a tech-focused blog? Completely unoriginal yet familiar and comforting. All I need to add is a Star Trek/Wars reference to cement my geek ‘cred’ and we could call it a day. Or I guess I could skip that and just say I authored this blog in vi.</p>
<p>So who am I and what is this blog for? My name is Tyler Britten and I am an IT infrastructure geek. I’m currently employed by EMC as a vSpecialist on the VMware Affinity Team. Previous to that I worked as technical consultant for a small infrastructure reseller, a network engineer for a Fortune 1000 company, and I also freelanced as an IT consultant for small businesses. I’ve also cleaned pools, directed traffic, been a short order cook, telemarketer, and made ice cream. I have certifications from EMC, Cisco, VMware, NetApp, Riverbed, Microsoft, CommVault, and I'm sure a few others.</p>
<p>I’m obviously fascinated by technology and I decided to start this blog (besides all the usual narcissistic reasons) to share not only my opinions, but also tips and tricks I discover along my travels with enterprise tech as well as consumer electronics. Of course, all opinions expressed are my own and do not represent my employer.</p>
<p>Hopefully you’ll find something interesting here. Of course feedback is always welcome.</p>
<p>Tyler</p>
