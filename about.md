So who am I and what is this blog for? My name is Tyler Britten and I am an IT infrastructure geek. I’m currently employed by Blue Box as a Technical Marketing Manager. Previous to that I was at EMC, most recently as a Principal Technical Marketing Manager focused on OpenStack and Cloud Foundry. Before that I was a vSpecialist for about four years, a technical consultant for a small infrastructure reseller, a network engineer for a Fortune 1000 company, and I also freelanced as an IT consultant for small businesses. I’ve also cleaned pools, directed traffic, been a short order cook, telemarketer, and made ice cream. I have certifications from EMC, Cisco, VMware, NetApp, Riverbed, Microsoft, CommVault, and I'm sure a few others.

I’m obviously fascinated by technology and I decided to start this blog (besides all the usual narcissistic reasons) to share not only my opinions, but also tips and tricks I discover along my travels with enterprise tech as well as consumer electronics. Of course, the required disclaimer:

*“The opinions expressed here are my personal opinions. Content published here is not read or approved in advance by my employer and does not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of my employer nor does it constitute any official communication of my employer.”*

Hopefully you’ll find something interesting here. Of course feedback is always welcome.

Tyler
